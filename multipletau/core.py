    """
    Autocorrelation of a 1-dimensional sequence on a log2-scale.

    This computes the correlation similar to
    :py:func:`numpy.correlate` for positive :math:`k` on a base 2
    logarithmic scale.

        :func:`numpy.correlate(a, a, mode="full")[len(a)-1:]`

        :math:`z_k = \\Sigma_n a_n a_{n+k}`


    Parameters
    ----------
    a: array-like
        input sequence
    m: even integer
        defines the number of points on one level, must be an
        even integer
    deltat: float
        distance between bins
    normalize: bool
        normalize the result to the square of the average input
        signal and the factor :math:`M-k`.
    copy: bool
        copy input array, set to ``False`` to save memory
    dtype: object to be converted to a data type object
        The data type of the returned array and of the accumulator
        for the multiple-tau computation.


    Returns
    -------
    autocorrelation: ndarray of shape (N,2)
        the lag time (1st column) and the autocorrelation (2nd column).

    Notes
    -----
    .. versionchanged:: 0.1.6
       Compute the correlation for zero lag time.

    The algorithm computes the correlation with the convention of the
    curve decaying to zero.

    For experiments like e.g. fluorescence correlation spectroscopy,
    the signal can be normalized to :math:`M-k`
    by invoking ``normalize = True``.

    For normalizing according to the behavior
    of :py:func:`numpy.correlate`, use ``normalize = False``.

    For complex arrays, this method falls back to the method
    :func:`correlate`.
